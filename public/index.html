  <h1>Browser Games</h1>

  <p>A collection of games to play in a web browser.</p>
  <p>Note: After the first couple of days, I felt like reproducing these games from scratch without looking at the solutions was well beyond my ZPD.
    So I followed along with a basic Tic Tac Toe tutorial and made that, and re-typed the FreeCodeCamp solution code for the two games (making some minor changes along the way).
    Unfortunately I was not ever able to get it to actually work, despite extensive searching for errors.
